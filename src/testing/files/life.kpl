⍝ Game of Life!
⍝ Life function first...
Life←{↑∨/1 ⍵∧3 4=+/,¯1 0 1∘.⊖¯1 0 1∘.⌽⊂⍵}

⍝ Define the "organism"
glider←3 3⍴1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
⍝ 1 1 1
⍝ 1 0 0
⍝ 0 1 0

⍝ Define the grid in which the organism lives
grid←¯10 ¯10↑glider

⍝ Run functions for consequtively applying the game.
run ← {{grid ← Life grid ◊ ⎕ ← grid}¨⍳⍵}

⍝ Run for 10 iterations.
